# Cody's Reading Notes

### Growth Mindset

> people with a growth mindset are constantly trying to learn and better themselves, people constantly looking for a challenge. Having a growth mindset is enjoying challenges The idea of having a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset is that people with a growth mindset are more willing to engage and face challenges head on rather than running away or looking for ways to circumvent them. Individuals with growth mindsets embrace challenges and want to learn from them, so they are better able to adapt how they approach situations in the future. 

1. failing to try is like trying to fail

### Markdown notes

>Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform. Markdown files are ended with eith .md or .markdown.
GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

- single back ticks can be used to block formatting, and triple back ticks on the top and bottom for blocks of text.
- using the `@` symbol you can mention specific people of companies.
- Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
- basic git commands: git status, git add, git command.
- If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:
`![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)`
- Any URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.
- You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:
- Any word wrapped with two tildes `(like ~~this~~)` will appear crossed out. ~example~
- you can use `#` to make headings you can use one `#` all the way up to six `######` one being the largest and six being the smallest
- `* *` can be use to *italicize* text
