# Loops Notes

Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops:

- for - the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run
- while true - can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the conditionis true
- do while - will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false

A For loop uses a counter as a condition. This instucts the code to run a specified number of times.

- loop
- iterate - each time it loops
- increment - increase (possibly by 1)
- decrement - decrease (possibly by 1)
