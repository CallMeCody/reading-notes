# Growth Mindset

> people with a growth mindset are constantly trying to learn and better themselves, people constantly looking for a challenge. Having a growth mindset is enjoying challenges The idea of having a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset is that people with a growth mindset are more willing to engage and face challenges head on rather than running away or looking for ways to circumvent them. Individuals with growth mindsets embrace challenges and want to learn from them, so they are better able to adapt how they approach situations in the future.
